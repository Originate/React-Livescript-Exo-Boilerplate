This module implements the
[delegation pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_pattern)
for JavaScript,
in the very popular and usable
[Rails style](http://apidock.com/rails/Module/delegate).


## Delegating methods

```javascript
delegate = require('rails-delegate').delegate;

function Car() {
  this.engine = new Engine();

  delegate('start', 'stop', 'cylinders', { from: this, to: this.engine });
};

myCar = new Car;
```

Now `myCar.start()` calls `myCar.engine.start()` and
`myCar.stop()` calls `myCar.engine.stop()`.
You can also access the property `myCar.cylinders`,
which contains the value of `myCar.engine.cylinders`.

More information in the spec for delegating [methods](features/delegating-methods.feature)
and [properties](features/delegating-properties.feature).
This library also provides meaningful [error messages](features/error-messages.feature).


## Delegating Events

You can also forward events emitted by wrapped classes.

```javascript
delegateEvent = require('rails-delegate').delegateEvent;

function Car() {
  this.engine = new Engine();

  delegateEvent('starting', 'stopping', { from: this.engine, to: this });
};
```

Now if `myCar.engine` emits a starting `starting` event,
`myCar` also emits that event.


## Alternatives

This library aims for maximally readable syntax
that closely matches the
[Rails version](http://apidock.com/rails/Module/delegate).
There are other libraries that are different and more versatile,
for example
[node-delegates](https://github.com/tj/node-delegates).
