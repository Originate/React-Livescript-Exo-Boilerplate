> Tools for managing NodeJS repositories according to
  [Originate's guidelines](https://github.com/Originate/guide/blob/master/javascript/node_js.md).


## Installation

```
$ npm i --save-dev o-tools-node
```

* make sure your $PATH includes `./bin` and `/node_modules/.bin` (in this order)

* add these scripts to the `bin` folder of your Node.JS code base
  and make them do their thing:

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>spec</th>
      <td>runs all tests and linters</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>build</th>
      <td>builds your project</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

* set up the CI server to automatically publish
  new releases from the `release` branch:
  * add a `deployment` section
    similar to [the one in this repo](circle.yml)
    to your circle.yml file
  * go to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/tokens)
    and copy the authentication token there into the clipboard
  * go to the project settings of your project on [CircleCI](https://circleci.com),
    and in the "Environment Variables" section add an environment variable
    named `AUTH_TOKEN` with the npm auth token as content.


## Tools

O-tools-node adds a number of command-line tools to your repo
to help you and others develop it more effectively:


* __setup:__
  Installs the Node.JS dependencies for your code base.
  To use a customized setup script for your code base,
  put your own `setup` script into your `./bin` folder.

  ```
  $ setup
  ```

* __lint:__
  runs [dependency-lint](https://github.com/charlierudolph/dependency-lint)

  ```
  $ lint
  ```

* __update-check:__
  checks whether updates to your dependencies are available

  ```
  $ update-check
  ```

* __update:__
  updates all your dependencies to their latest versions.

  ```
  $ update
  ```

* __publish:__
  releases a new version to NPM

  ```
  $ publish <patch|minor|major>
  ```
