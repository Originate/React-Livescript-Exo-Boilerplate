## Development
To get started on development, run:
* `exo setup` - this will run `npm install` in every service's directory
* `exo run` - this will run the application and you can view it by visiting localhost:3000 in your browser.

Note: Be sure MongoDb is installed and running `mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf`
